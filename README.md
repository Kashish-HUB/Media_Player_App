The Media Player App is a simple yet efficient application designed to allow users to play music files directly from their local storage. The app provides a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to browse through their music library, select tracks, and control playback. By leveraging Android's native `MediaPlayer` class and `ContentResolver`, this app fetches all the music files stored on the device and enables seamless music playback.

### **Features and Functionality**

1. **Music Library Access**  
   The app uses Android's `MediaStore` API to access all audio files on the device’s local storage. It queries the device’s external storage to retrieve details such as the title, artist, and file path of each music track. This allows the app to build a list of available songs, which is then displayed to the user through a simple yet effective **RecyclerView** layout. Users can scroll through and select any track to play.

2. **Media Playback**  
   Upon selecting a song, the app utilizes the `MediaPlayer` class to handle audio playback. The `MediaPlayer` is initialized with the file path of the selected track and starts playing the song. It also handles basic controls such as play, pause, and stop. The app’s interface displays the current song being played and allows users to control the playback status with buttons for **Play** and **Pause**.

3. **User Interface Design**  
   The app features a minimalistic and easy-to-navigate interface. The main screen showcases a **RecyclerView**, listing all available songs from the music library. Each item in the list includes the song title and allows users to tap on a song to begin playing it. Below the list, simple **Play** and **Pause** buttons provide control over the current track. The design is responsive and ensures smooth operation on various screen sizes.

4. **Permissions and Privacy**  
   The app requests the necessary permissions to read external storage, ensuring it can access all audio files stored on the device. On devices running Android 6.0 (API 23) and above, runtime permissions are implemented to comply with Android's security standards.

5. **Enhancements and Future Features**  
   While the current version of the app provides basic functionality, there is potential for future enhancements. Features such as adding a seekbar for tracking playback progress, shuffle and repeat functionality, or displaying album art and song metadata can be implemented to improve user experience. The addition of a background service for uninterrupted playback when the app is minimized is also a potential upgrade.

### **Conclusion**  
This music player app effectively provides a simple and efficient way to enjoy music from a user’s local library. With a straightforward approach to music playback, an intuitive user interface, and easy access to local music files, it serves as a perfect foundation for a more feature-rich media player app. Future updates could expand its functionality, offering a more customized and immersive experience.
